# Model Evaluation Toolkit in R

This project includes R scripts that calculate essential performance metrics for predictive models. The scripts work with two types of data: categorical predictions and continuous variable predictions, each requiring distinct evaluation strategies.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- **R**: You need R installed on your machine to run the script.

### Required R Packages:
- **readr**: For reading CSV files.
- **knitr**: For reporting features.
  - Install the necessary packages using R:
    ```R
    install.packages(c("readr", "knitr"))
    ```

### Execution
- Clone this repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/model-evaluation-toolkit.git
  cd model-evaluation-toolkit
  ```
- Run the R script:
  ```bash
  Rscript model_evaluation_toolkit.R
  ```

### File Structure
- `model_evaluation_toolkit.R`: Main script file containing R code for calculating model evaluation metrics.

### Contributing
Contributions to enhance or extend the analysis are welcome. Please adhere to this simple workflow:
- Fork the repository.
- Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
- Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
- Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).
- Open a pull request.

## üß© Project Purpose

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Categorical Model Evaluation
- **Confusion Matrix Calculation**: Computes components such as True Positives (TP) and False Negatives (FN).
- **Metric Calculation**: Derives metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the accuracy of a classification model.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Continuous Model Evaluation
- **Error Metrics Calculation**: Calculates Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) and R¬≤ to evaluate the fit of regression models.
- **Model Comparison**: Analyzes two models to determine which better predicts continuous targets.
